# 📁 FTP Server Simulation – Cisco Packet Tracer

This project is a university-level networking simulation created in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It shows how **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is used to share files between devices in a structured network.

---

## 📄 Description

The simulation models a small local area network (LAN) with an FTP server and multiple client devices.  
Each client is configured to connect to the server using standard FTP credentials, allowing for file uploads and downloads.  
This setup is ideal for practicing FTP-based file sharing, testing authentication, and understanding basic TCP/IP communication in a networked environment.

Whether you're studying network fundamentals or prepping for an exam, this simulation gives hands-on experience with how file transfer actually works in a real-world scenario.

## 🔧 What’s Included

- A working FTP server setup  
- Clients configured to access and transfer files  
- Fully connected network with proper addressing  
- `.pkt` file ready to simulate and test

---

## 📂 Project File

- `ftp_simulation.pkt` – Main Packet Tracer simulation file

---

## 🧰 Tools Required

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**  
  > Download it from the [Cisco NetAcad site](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer  
2. Review the IP settings and device configurations  
3. Use client PCs to connect to the FTP server  
4. Test uploading/downloading files and observe the process

---

## 📌 Purpose

This lab is designed for educational use—ideal for students learning how FTP works, how servers handle file requests, and how clients communicate over TCP/IP.
